Restaurant
GET All Restaurants /restaurants
POST One Restaurant /restaurants

GET One Restaurant /restaurants/{id}
PUT One Restaurant /restaurants/{id}
DELETE One Restaurant /restaurants/{id}

Menu
GET All Menus /menus -> niche use case, probably for Data team
GET One Menu /menus/${id}

GET All Menus by Restaurant /restaurants/{id}/menus
GET One Menu by Restaurant /restaurants/{id}/menus/{id}
PUT One Menu by Restaurant /restaurants/{id}/menus/{id}
DELETE One Menu by Restaurant /restaurants/{id}/menus/{id}
*Note: there is no POST /menus, PUT | DELETE /menus/{id},
because in order to create a menu, we MUST FIRST create a restaurant.
